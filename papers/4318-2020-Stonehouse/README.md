# Risk Modeling on the Fast-Track: Pythonistas (and others) Harness the Power of the SAS Risk Engine

This GIT repository includes the sample code to go along with the SGF Paper for this topic.
Find the "Risk Modeling on the Fast Track" paper online in the [SAS Global Forum proceedings](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum/program/proceedings.html).

## About riskpy

The riskpy package helps Python developers to rapidly create risk models leveraging the SAS Risk Engine CAS actions.

Risk models are developed as a system of Python object types, including things like:

*  Portfolio
*  Counterparty
*  MarketData
*  Evaluation
*  Results

A user can create a risk model flow using the SAS Risk Engine using
just the vocabulary they would need to express their need.

## Current Status

The riskpy package is under development.  To request a demo and get more information, please go to the [Risk Engines page](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/risk-engine.html) on sas.com. Bookmark this page and come back to get updates on availability of the package.

## Examples

In the Examples directory, there are Python modules and Jupyter notebooks that correspond to the Market Risk and Credit Risk examples in the paper.
